Z-32 CPU Specification
======================
Version 0.3 (WIP)


SUMMARY
=======

* 32 bit CISC CPU
* 0x10000 address space
* 11 generic purpuse registers (A, B, C, X, Y, Z, I, J, K, BP, SP)
* program counter (PC)
* Flags Register (FLAGS)
* Interrupt address (IA)
* Little endian

In this document, anything within [brackets] is shorthand for "the value of the
RAM at the location of the value inside the brackets". For example, SP means
stack pointer, but [SP] means the value of the RAM at the location the stack
pointer is pointing at. Also in the notation we will use
BYTES for 8 bit values, WORDS for 16 bit values and DWORDs for 32 bit values. 

Whenever the CPU needs to read a byte, it reads [PC], then increases PC by one.
Shorthand for this is [PC++]. In some cases, the CPU will modify a value before
reading it, in this case the shorthand is [++PC].

For stability and to reduce bugs, it's strongly suggested all multi-word
operations use little endian in all Z-32 programs, wherever possible.


FLAGS register
--------------

- BIT 31-11-> Reserved
- BIT 10 -> ENABLE DIVISION ERRORS (TDE)
- BIT 9 -> ENABLE OVERFLOW ERRORS (TOE)
- BIT 8 -> ENABLE SINGLE-STEP MODE (TSS)
- BIT 4-7 -> Reserved
- BIT 3 -> INTERRUPT FLAG: 1 If an interrupt is happening. (IF)
- BIT 2 -> DIVISION ERROR FLAG: 1 If was a division error. (DE)
- BIT 1 -> OVERFLOW FLAG: 1 If an arithmetic operation overflowed. (OF)
- BIT 0 -> CARRY FLAG: 1 If the last ADDx/SUBx carried or borrowed a bit. (CF)


INSTRUCTIONS
============

Instructions are 1-7 bytes long and are fully defined by the first byte.
The first byte is the instruction opcode, and have this format (in LSB-0 
format) :

    76543210
    NNoooooo

Where :

- NN is the number of parameters that the instruction needs, from 0 to 2.
- ooooo the opcode


Note that could be two different instructions with the same opcode but different number of parameters. This means that NN (number of parameters) defines a different opcode spaces.

The first byte is followed byte NN bytes that defines each parameter. The first
parameter byte is the parameter a, the second parameter byte is the parameter 
b, and the third parameter byte is the paramater c.

In the tables below, C is the time required in cycles to look up the value, or
perform the opcode, VALUE is the numerical value, NAME is the mnemonic, and
DESCRIPTION is a short text that describes the opcode or value.


    --- Parameter Byte ------------------------------------------------------------
     C | VALUE     | DESCRIPTION
    ---+-----------+---------------------------------------------------------------
     0 | 0x00-0x0A | register (A, B, C, X, Y, Z, I, J, K, BP or SP in that order)
     1 | 0x0B-0x15 | [register] byte  (read/write a byte)
     1 | 0x1A-0x20 | [register] word  (read/write a word)
     1 | 0x21-0x2B | [register] dword (read/write a dword)
     2 | 0x2C-0x36 | [register + next dword] byte  (r/w a byte)
     2 | 0x37-0x41 | [register + next dword] word  (r/w a word)
     2 | 0x42-0x4C | [register + next dword] dword (r/w a dword)
     1 |      0x4D | [next dword] byte
     1 |      0x4E | [next dword] word
     1 |      0x4F | [next dword] dword
     0 |      0x50 | PC
     0 |      0x51 | FLAGS
     1 |      0x52 | next dword (literal) (only for a)
     0 | 0x32-0xFF | literal value (-86..87) (literal) (only for a)
    ---+-----------+---------------------------------------------------------------
    
* "next dword" means the next dword after the last byte parameter. Increases the byte
  length of the instruction by 4.
* Attempting to write to a literal value fails silently

* The conditional opcodes take one cycle longer to perform if the test fails.
  When they skip a conditional instruction, they will skip an additional
  instruction at the cost of one extra cycle. This continues until a non-
  conditional instruction has been skipped. This lets you easily chain
  conditionals. Interrupts are not triggered while the Z-32 is skipping.
    
* Signed numbers are represented using two's complement.


INTERRUPTS
==========

The Z-32 will perform at most one interrupt between each instruction.

When IA is set to something other than 0, interrupts triggered on the Z-32
will set high IACQ signal to High, to indicate to hardware that is busy handling
an interrupt. Then will push PC and A registers in the stack, followed by 
setting the PC to IA, and A to the interrupt message. Also, IF flags will be set
to 1.
 
If IA is set to 0, a triggered interrupt does nothing. Software interrupts still
take up 5 clock cycles, but immediately return, incoming hardware interrupts
are ignored. 

Interrupt handlers should end with RFI, which will clean IF flag and pop A and 
PC from the stack as a single atomic instruction, plus restores IACQ signal to 
Low value, to indicate to hardware that the CPU can handle now an
new interrupt.

The interrupt messages should be defined by hardware devices specs. But there a
few interrupts that could be launched by the T-16 itself, when meets some
special conditions like Division error, Overflow or if single-step mode is
active.


INTERRUPT LIST
--------------

- If a division error happens, **TDE** bit is enable and **INTERRUPT FLAG** is not enable, the Z-32 will throw an interrupt with message 0.
- If a overflow error happens, **TOE** bit is enable and **INTERRUPT FLAG** is not enable, the Z-32 will throw an interrupt with message 4.
- If single-step mode is active (**TSS** bit is enable) and **INTERRUPT FLAG** is not enable, the Z-32 will throw an interrupt with message 1.

HARDWARE
========   

The Z-32 supports up to 256 connected hardware devices. These devices can
be anything from additional storage, sensors, monitors or speakers.
How to control the hardware is specified per hardware device, but the Z-32
supports memory mapped devices and IO address mapped devices.
