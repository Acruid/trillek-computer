RC3200 (RISC CPU 3200) Specification
====================================
Version 0.5 (WIP) 


SUMMARY
=======

 * 32 bit RISC CPU
 * 32 general purpose registers (%r0 to %r31)
 * Multiplication/Quotient register Y
 * Base Pointer (%bp = %r14) and Stack Pointer (%sp = R15) 
 * Flags Register (FLAGS)
 * Interrupt Address (IA)
 * Little Endian

In this document, anything within [brackets] is shorthand for 
"the value of the RAM at the location of the value inside the brackets". 
For example, %sp register is "stack pointer", but [%sp] means the value of the RAM 
at the location the stack pointer is pointing. Also in the notation we will use
BYTES for 8 bit values, WORDS for 16 bit values and DWORDs for 32 bit values. 

The RC3200 instruction set is based in 32 bit dwords, so each time that the PC 
is incremented, is incremented by four. Also is Little Endian, so the MSB of a 
word or dword is stored in the lowest address, and the LSB is stored in the 
highest address.

Whenever the CPU needs to read a instruction, it reads [PC], then increases PC
by four as a instruction uses dword. Shorthand for this is [PC+4]. In some 
cases, the CPU will modify a value before reading it, in this case the 
shorthand is [++X]. When we say that the RC3200 Push a value to the Stack, 
writes these value at [--%sp]. When we say that RC3200 Pops a value from the 
stack, reads a value from [%sp++]. Remember that we work with 32 bit values in
Little Endian, so to store a value in the stack, we need to push each byte of 
the dword value.

Also the internal architecture is a not pipelined 4 stages (FETCH, DECODE,
EXECUTE, RAM WRITE/READ), So the majority of instructions need only 3 cycles 
to be fully executed, with the exception of multiplication/division 
instructions, that halts the EXECUTE stage using the internal ALU to do a
multiplication or division, load/store instructions that uses the fourth 
stage; and any instruction that uses the stack because uses the fourth stage 
times as often stack is used.


 Registers :
 
  - %r0 .. %r31 - General Purpose Registers (GPR)
  - %r14 - %bp - Base Pointer  -> Use as pointer to the local frame in the stack  
  - %r15 - %sp - Stack Pointer -> Points to the last value Pushed in the stack
  - FLAGS register
  - Y - Multiplication/Division register
  - IA - Interrupt Address
  - PC - Program Counter  

FLAGS register :

  - BIT 31-10-> Reserved
  - BIT 11   -> ENABLE DIVISION ERRORS (TDE)
  - BIT 10   -> ENABLE OVERFLOW ERRORS  (TOE)
  - BIT 9    -> ENABLE SINGLE-STEP MODE (TSS)
  - BIT 9    -> ENABLE INTERRUPT (TI)
  - BIT 4-7  -> Reserved
  - BIT 3    -> INTERRUPT FLAG: 1 If an interrupt is happening. (IF)
  - BIT 2    -> DIVISION ERROR FLAG: 1 If was a division error. (DE)
  - BIT 1    -> OVERFLOW FLAG: 1 If an arithmetic operation overflowed. (OF)
  - BIT 0    -> CARRY FLAG: 1 If the last ADDx/SUBx carried or borrowed a bit. (CF)

If TOE bit is enabled, the RC3200  will generated an appropriated interrupt if an overflow happens.

If TDE bit is enabled, the RC3200  will generated an appropriated interrupt if an division error happens.

If TSS bit is enable, the RC3200  will generate an appropriated interrupt with message 1.

The Carry flag gets his value, doing a XOR of the carry bit and the sign bit of the result, when an arithmetic operation happens.

BOOT/RESET STATUS
-----------------

All registers are set to 0 when the RC3200 boot-up or does a reset.

M bit marks if r2 is a 5 bit literal or a register. 5 bit Literals are defined 
from 15 to -15 in complement two. -16 Literal (1 0000) is reserved to mark that
the next dword is a 32 bit Long Literal value. 
Access to the next dword for a Long Literals takes a extra clock cycle.

BRANCHING OPERATIONS
--------------------

  The conditional opcodes take one cycle longer to perform if the test fails.
  When they skip a conditional instruction, they will skip an additional
  instruction at the cost of one extra cycle. This continues until a non-
  conditional instruction has been skipped. This lets you easily chain
  conditionals. Interrupts are not triggered while the RC3200  is skipping.

STACK INSTRUCTIONS
------------------

    PUSH REG3       
    PUSH LITERAL

  Writes a dword value to the stack. As the RC32000 is little endian, It push 
  each byte of dword value to the stack, so the %sp register decrements his 
  value by 4.
  
    POP REG3
  
  Reads from the stack a dword value and stores it in the REG3 register. As the
  RC32000 is little endian, It pops each byte of dword value from the stack, so
  the %sp register incremented his value by 4.

Note that all stack operations writes/reads **ALWAYS** a dword.

    SETIA REG3           Sets IA to REG3 register value
    SETIA LITERAL        "
    
    RFI                  Return from interrupt. Pops PC and pops r0. 
                         Also cleans INTERRUPT FLAG and IACK signal.

  

INTERRUPTS
==========    

The RC3200 uses what is know how interrupt polling handling scheme. There is 
not is a vector table, instead there is only a interrupt vector were the OS 
installs a ISR, that polls FLAGS register and/or reads %r0 register to discover 
what kind of interrupt happen and who launch it.

When the TI bit om FLAGS register is enable, then the interrupts are enabled. 
Interrupts can be generated by software by INT instruction or by hardware 
getting to Low the INT line. An interrupt is processed when the RC3200  
is ready to process a new instruction (instructions are atomic). When an 
interrupt is being processed, the IACQ line goes to high indicating that the 
RC3200 will ignore the INT line or any software interrupt This means that all 
interrupts are atomic.

When a Interrupt happens, the RC3200 puts IACK signal to High, push to the 
stack the values of %r0 and PC registers, jumps to IA address, and sets the 
INTERRUPT FLAG to 1. If it's a software interrupt, the message is put on %r0 to 
be processed. If it's a hardware interrupt, sets %r0 to value read in the data 
bus. (%r0 contains always the message from software or hardware interrupt)

When the interrupt service routine ends executing a RFI, the RC3200 pops PC and
%r0 registers, sets IACK (Interrupt Acknowledge) signal to Low, and the 
INTERRUPT FLAG is set to 0.

When a software interrupt is launched but TI is disable or the RC32 is 
procesing a interrupt, the INT instrucction wil take 6 cycles to execute, but 
will act as a NOP.


INTERRUPT LIST
--------------

The interrupt messages should be defined by hardware devices specs. But there a
few interrupts that could be launched by the RC3200 itself, when meets some
special conditions like Division error, Overflow or if single-step mode is
active.

- If a division error happens and TDE bit is enable, the RC3200  will throw an 
interrupt with message 0.
- If a overflow error happens and TOE bit is enable, the RC3200  will throw an 
interrupt with message 4.
- If single-step mode is active (TSS bit is enable) and INTERRUPT FLAG is not 
enable, the RC3200  will throw an interrupt with message 1, when executes any 
instruction.


HARDWARE
========  

The RC3200 handles hardware devices as memory maped. The usual addresses uses by
the devices begins at 0xFF000000, that is the last 16 megabyte of the address space. 


EXAMPLE MEMORY MAP
------------------

The memory map is defined by the OS and computer architecture, but here we give
a example memory map for a 1MiB RAM+ROM and a graphics device at 0xFF0B0000:

It uses a 4KiB video ram to represent a text only video mode, and uses a 64Kib
ROM that works as Basic Input Output System that sets the hardware, gives some 
basic ISRs gives some util functions, and launch user code from a floppy.

ELECTRICAL SIGNALS
==================

- Data Bus (Input/Output) of 32 bits
- Address Bus (Input/Output) of 32 bits
- R/W (Output): Low to signal that the CPU ask to read an address, High to
  signal that the CPU writes an address.
- _INT (Input): Used to signal the CPU that a hardware interrupt is hapening
- IACQ (Output): Indicates that the CPU is procesing an interrupt and will not
  accept new interrupts. Only can accpet new interrupts if is low.
- _RESET (Input): Resets the CPU state if a edge from High to Low hapens.
- _Wait (Input): Makes to the CPU wait at actual stage. Used to arbitrate in
  multi-cpu systems and DMA use of the bus.
- AD_ACT (Output): Indicates that the CPU is using the Address and Data bus


PROTOCOLS
---------

### Sending an interrupt

1.   Pull down _INT line only if IACQ is low
2.   Wait to IACQ gets High
3.   When IACQ gets High, put at data bus the interrupt messsage.
4.   Release _INT line
5.   Wait to IACQ gets Low -> End Of Interrupt (EOI)
